# table-scanner-fullstack
This is an application that provides a UI which enables photos of tables to be uploaded, parsed and downloaded in a CSV format. The frontend UI enables users to quickly scale lines over the photo of the graph which enables the program to yeild more accurate results.
Over the following days I will automize the setup as much as I can and provide instructions in this README to get this program setup on any computer. I will also publish the application once I beleive it is ready.
A Link to a demo of how to use the UI is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9eFWnF_Os.

## Set up
